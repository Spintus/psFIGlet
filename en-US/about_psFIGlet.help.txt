Credit for the implementations of the FIGlet algorithms which have been
rewritten in PowerShell here belongs to Patrick Gillespie (patorjk) for his
excellent figlet.js project (https://github.com/patorjk/figlet.js), without
which I likely would never have gotten so far on this.

I have simply rewritten his JS into PowerShell, broken stuff out into a more
navigable module format, and made stuff like function calls and internal logic
more "PowerShell-ey".

If you're interested in FIGlet and FIGDrivers, I highly recommend checking out
figlet.js and the accompanying website which uses it:

This PowerShell code aims to fully implement the FIGlet spec.
